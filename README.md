INTRODUCTION

In this project, we gathered, reviewed, and cleaned data related to the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. The final data includes the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, image predictions from a machine learning model, and tweet data gathered using the Twitter API wrapper, tweepy.

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
